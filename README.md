## Introduction
- This is a simple project in which web app takes a python defination as input and produces a DocString. This DocString can be downloaded as text file.
- I have used **OpenAI API** and used their **code-davinci-002** model to get the DocString.
## Installation

Create a **python 3.7** Envirnoment using conda or python-virtualenv
```bash
conda create -n <env-name> python=3.7
```
activate the Envirnoment
```bash
conda activate <env-name>
```
install necessary files using requirements.txt
```bash
pip -r install requirements.txt
```
